                <p>If you’re considering making an FAQ page and don’t know if it’s completely necessary, that’s ok. An FAQ page is almost always appropriate. If you get lots of the same questions over and over again, then you definitely need to create an FAQ page. When you have a blog with a multitude of great content, an FAQ page is needed to educate customers about your product through those articles.It's good to have categories laid out on the landing page of your FAQ section. However, there are likely some questions that are more popular than others. To save customers even more time, these top questions should have their own section and a link to their answer at the top of your FAQ page. That way you can maintain your categorical organization while making your most commonly asked questions more accessible.It's good to have categories laid out on the landing page of your FAQ section.

                <p>As you'll see from the examples below, not every FAQ page looks the same.
